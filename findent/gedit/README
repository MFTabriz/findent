usage of findent in gedit

to use findent as external tool:
# in gedit:
#    Edit -> preferences -> enable "External Tools"
#    Tools -> Manage External Tools -> Add
#       - rename "New Tool" into findent
#       - put the file findent-gedit in the tool, or place a command
#          in the tool that starts this script
#       Shortcut Key:  <Alt>F1    (or something more to your liking)
#       Save:          Nothing
#       Input:         Current document
#       Output:        Replace current document
#       Applicability: All documents   Fortran 95
#       

   Alternatively, if all is well, it would be sufficient to place
   the command
      findent -Ia -i3
   in the tool, but the script findent-gedit does some sanity checks
   to prevent "oops" experiences.

To use findent as plugin:

# cp findent.py findent.plugin $HOME/.local/share/gedit/plugins
# in gedit:
#   Edit -> preferences -> plugins -> check: findent
  findent is available in popup menu (right-click) and
  shortcut <Ctrl><Alt>f . You can change that in 
  findent.py, look for the definition of 'shortcut'.
  Advantage of plugin over external tool: gedit scrolls
  back to point where you called findent.
