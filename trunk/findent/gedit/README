usage of findent in gedit

# in gedit:
#    Edit -> preferences -> enable "External Tools"
#    Tools -> Manage External Tools -> Add
#       - rename "New Tool" into findent
#       - put the file findent-gedit in the tool, or place a command
#          in the tool that starts this script
#       Shortcut Key:  <Alt>F1    (or something more to your liking)
#       Save:          Nothing
#       Input:         Current document
#       Output:        Replace current document
#       Applicability: All documents   Fortran 95
#       

Alternatively, if all is well, it would be sufficient to place
the command
   findent -Ia -i3
in the tool, but the script findent-gedit does some sanity checks
to prevent "oops" experiences.
